# Handling Editor

## Custom Events

I copied the vehiclechecker.lua from baseevents.lua and made a client-only variant. The events are as follows:

* clientEnteredVehicle
* clientLeftVehicle
* clientEnterVehicleAborted
* clientEnteringVehicle

Source is not specified. The source is always the local player.
